    <p>Welcome to our game, Maze Marauders!</p>
    <p>So you want to dive into the game, here are some tips, tricks, and instructions to prepare you for the trials that await!</p>
    <p>First the basics, navigating the main character requires the use of the 'WASD' keys. 'W' to move upwards, 'A' to move left, 'S' to move downwards, and 'D' to move right.</p>
    <p>The game will start you off in the middle of a dense labyrinth. With depleting resources, a basic (rusty) sword, and simply a burning torch, you don't have much time. At the top-left of your screen, you'll notice a counter, indicated by a torch icon. That is how long you have until you unfortunately succumb to the coldness...</p>
    <p>If your timer runs out, then the darkness will 'come to life' and you'll face the boss!! During the boss fight, the torch counter at the top-left serves as your health bar. It's a good idea to gather as many resources and improve your gear before you face the boss however.</p>
    <p>But wait, is that what you think it is? You'll notice that throughout the maze there are kindling sparsed around. Represented by the small torch icons, you can pick up kindling to re-ignite your torch and add time to your counter, effectively giving you more opportunity to explore the labyrinth and level-up your gear.</p>
    <p>You'll notice a few objects scattered throughout the maze. First are blue tier-1 gems. These gems can be used to craft higher-tier gems (up to tier 4). Using tiered gems, you can upgrade the level of your weapon. There are also sticks, stones, and feathers throughout the maze.</p>
    <p>You can craft to boost your weapon's effectiveness. Adding a stick to your weapon will increase its range, a stone will increase its attack damage (sharpness), and a feather will increase its attack speed. You can add up to any two to customize your weapon and improve its buffs!</p>
    <p>Crafting bench: Here, you can upgrade your weapon through two ways. The first is through leveling, and the second is through accessories. 
         1) To level up your weapons, in the crafting menu, you can add your weapon and a gem of the same tier - the result will be a weapon of the next level.
         2) To add accessories, in the crafting menu, you can add a stone, feather, or stick to the two slots at the bottom - the result will be a weapon with those accessories.
    </p>
    <p> Anvil: When you get a tier 2 weapon, you need a gem of the same tier to level it up. Combine 4 tier 1 gems to get a tier 2 gem, allowing you to further upgrade your weapon to tier 3. Similarly, combine 4 tier 2s into a tier 3, or 3 tier 3s into a tier 4.
    </p>
    <p>We don't want to give too much away, go out there and explore! It's now up to you adventurer, good luck!</p>
